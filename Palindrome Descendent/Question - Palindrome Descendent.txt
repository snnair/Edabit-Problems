A number may not be a palindrome, but its descendant can be. A number's direct child is created by summing each pair of adjacent digits to create the digits of the next number.

For instance, 123312 is not a palindrome, but its next child 363 is, where: 3 = 1 + 2; 6 = 3 + 3; 3 = 1 + 2.

Create a function that returns True if the number itself is a palindrome or any of its descendants down to the first 2 digit number (a 1-digit number is trivially a palindrome).

Examples
palindrome_descendant(11211230) ➞ True
# 11211230 ➞ 2333 ➞ 56 ➞ 11

palindrome_descendant(13001120) ➞ True
# 13001120 ➞ 4022 ➞ 44

palindrome_descendant(23336014) ➞ True
# 23336014 ➞ 5665

palindrome_descendant(11) ➞ True
# Number itself is a palindrome
Notes
Numbers will always have an even number of digits.
